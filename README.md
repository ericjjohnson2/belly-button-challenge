Data Visualization with JavaScript

January 2024

Worked with study group with Weinei and Lucinda, instructor during afterhours, and used ChatGPT to help debug. Also used AskBCS though did not use code directly from it. 
referenced https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach and Instructor explained how that worked instead of the loops we used in class. Used feedback from tutoring through Bootcamp/Canvas.
